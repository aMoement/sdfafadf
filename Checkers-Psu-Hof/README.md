<h1> Hello Everyone! </h1>
Welcome Penn State Abington and Hof-University!

I'm glad we are all working together.

This github is very simple. Download the zip or run a "git pull" command from terminal if using Ubuntu or Unix(Mac OS) and open the index.html file.

<h1> Rules </h1>

There are some rules: You must create a new branch from the "develop" branch. When you want to push your changes to the new branch, you must push your changes to your branch and create a pull request (PR) and assign myself as a reviewer.
